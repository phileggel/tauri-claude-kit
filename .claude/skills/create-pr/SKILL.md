name: create-pr
description: Push the current feature branch and open a GitHub pull request. Drafts PR title from the branch name and commits; drafts body from branch commits and the feature plan doc if present. Requires gh CLI. Use at the end of any feature branch workflow.
tools: Bash, Read, AskUserQuestion

# Skill — `create-pr`

Invocation: `/create-pr`

---

## Step 1 — Pre-flight checks

Run in parallel:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

```bash
git status --short
```

```bash
bash scripts/branch.sh log
```

```bash
gh auth status 2>&1 | head -3
```

- **On `main`**: stop — "You must be on a feature branch to create a PR."
- **Uncommitted changes**: list the files and stop — "Commit or stash changes before opening a PR."
- **No commits ahead of main**: stop — "No commits on this branch to open a PR for."
- **`gh` not authenticated**: stop — "Run `gh auth login` first, then retry `/create-pr`."

## Step 2 — Detect branch-name drift, then draft title (conventional commit format)

The PR title MUST be a conventional commit (`type(scope?): subject`). When the project uses GitHub's "Squash and merge", the PR title becomes the squash commit message on `main` — the local `commit-msg` hook does NOT run server-side, so this is the only gate. Validate before showing.

### Step 2a — Drift detection (active, not just advisory)

Parse the branch name's conventional type from the prefix (`feat/` → `feat`, etc.; default `chore` if no recognised prefix).

Parse each commit's conventional type from `git log --pretty=%s` and collect the set of types present.

**Compute the effective PR type via the priority hierarchy** (NOT by commit count — a 1-feat + 3-test PR is still a `feat`, not a `test`):

1. **Tier 1 — user-visible**: if any `feat` AND any `fix` are present → **ask the user via AskUserQuestion** which type the PR is really about (count-based picking is unreliable here; the human knows which is the main story). If only one tier-1 type is present, use it.
2. **Tier 2 — internal structural**: `refactor`. Only chosen if no tier-1 type appears.
3. **Tier 3 — plumbing**: `chore`, `ci`. Pick by count if both appear (chore wins on tie).
4. **Tier 4 — supporting**: `test`, `docs`. Pick by count if both appear (docs wins on tie).

The effective type is the highest tier present in the commits. Lower-tier commits in the same PR are "supporting" the effective type and are fine to include.

**Compare the effective type to the branch type:**

- **Match** — branch type == effective type → continue silently.
- **Mismatch** — branch type ≠ effective type → **challenge the user via AskUserQuestion**:

  > The branch is named `<branch>` (type: `<branch-type>`), but the effective PR type (by tier priority) is `<effective-type>`. Commits by type: `<breakdown>`.
  >
  > This usually means the work drifted during dev and the branch name no longer reflects what's in the PR.
  >
  > Options:
  >
  > - **Rename branch** (recommended) — abort; user runs `git branch -m <effective-type>/<short-description>` then re-runs `/create-pr`.
  > - **Use effective type for PR title** — proceed with `<effective-type>` in the title; branch name stays inconsistent.
  > - **Keep branch type for PR title** — proceed with `<branch-type>`; the title's type will differ from what the PR actually does.

### Step 2b — Drafting algorithm

1. **Single commit ahead of main** — prefer the commit's message as the title (keep its conventional prefix intact; do NOT strip).
2. **Multiple commits** — derive from the branch name (using the resolved type from Step 2a):
   - The rest of the branch name (hyphens/underscores → spaces, lowercase) becomes the subject.
   - Compose: `<resolved-type>: <subject>`.

### Step 2c — Validation

- Title must match `^(feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor|test|ci)(\(.+\))?!?: .+`.
- Title length ≤ 72 chars.

If validation fails, do NOT show a broken candidate. Tell the user: "Couldn't draft a valid conventional title from this branch + commits. Please supply one." and require an Other-input.

Display the validated candidate:

> Draft title: `feat: add payment gateway` (27 chars)

## Step 3 — Draft body

1. Run `bash scripts/branch.sh log` and collect all commit messages — used as **input** to summarise what changed; do NOT enumerate them in the PR body. GitHub's Commits tab already provides this view, and squash-merge configs (PR_TITLE + BLANK body) discard the PR body anyway, so an inline commit list is duplication + drift risk every time a new commit is pushed.
2. Check for a plan doc: `Glob docs/plan/*-plan.md`. If one matches the branch domain, `Read` it and extract the feature description from the top section.
3. Produce a body in this format — keep it concise:

```
## Summary
{2–4 bullet points summarising what changed, derived from commits or plan}

## Test plan
- [ ] {inferred from commit messages, plan doc, or reviewer steps completed}
- [ ] All checks pass (`just check-full`)
```

## Step 4 — Ask user to review title and body

Use **AskUserQuestion** (two questions in one call):

- **Q1** — "PR title — accept or edit?" pre-populate options with the draft title as Recommended; user selects or provides Other.
- **Q2** — "PR body — accept or edit?" options: Accept (Recommended) / Edit (user types replacement via Other).

## Step 5 — Confirm before pushing

Display:

> Ready to push `{branch}` to origin and open PR: `{title}`
> **This will make the branch and PR public.**

Use **AskUserQuestion** with Yes / Cancel. Stop if cancelled.

## Step 6 — Push and create PR

First, detect the default branch:

```bash
git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | grep -o '[^ ]*$'
```

Use the result as `{base}` (fall back to `main` if the command fails or returns empty).

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Use the **Write** tool to put the body in a temp file (avoids shell-quoting issues with multi-line markdown), then call `gh pr create` with `--body-file`:

1. Write `{body}` to `/tmp/pr-body.md` via the Write tool.
2. Run:

```bash
gh pr create --title "{title}" --base {base} --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

3. Run:

```bash
rm /tmp/pr-body.md
```

Each Bash call is a single literal command — allowlistable as `Bash(gh pr create *)` and `Bash(rm /tmp/pr-body.md)`.

## Step 7 — Show result

Output the PR URL returned by `gh pr create`. Done.

## Critical Rules

1. Never proceed if on `main`
2. Never proceed with uncommitted changes
3. Never push without explicit user confirmation (Step 5)
4. Never bypass `gh` authentication check
